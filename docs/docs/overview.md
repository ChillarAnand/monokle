On subsequent start-ups, Monokle Desktop automatically loads the most recently selected folder, if the corresponding "Load recent folder on Startup" setting has been enabled:

## **Working with Projects**

Click **Select an existing folder** to add your project folder containing K8 resources. 

Monokle Desktop is laid out like many other desktop applications:

![Monokle Desktop UI](img/monokle-ui-2.0.png)

Left to right:

- The vertical toolbar to the far left is where you will find functions like Resource Compare, views for Validation Errors, Git Operations, Cluster Dashboard and Settings which will be described later in the documentation.
- The File Explorer (shown in screenshot) shows the contents of the currently selected folder.
- The Navigator in the center shows all resources found in the current folder or cluster. By default it shows all possible
  Resource sections and subsections - when selecting a folder or cluster only those sections that actually contain
  any resources will be shown.
- The Editor section to the right contains editors/views/actions for the currently selected resource or file.

The top right contains the following buttons:

- The current K8s schema version.
- The currently configured cluster.
