Selecting either a file or resource in the Navigator will show its contents in the Source Editor. The editor will syntax-highlight for YAML and provide context-sensitive help and auto-complete functionality for standard Kubernetes objects.

Right-clicking in the editor shows a list of available commands. Pressing F1 opens its command-palette:
